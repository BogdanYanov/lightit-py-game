# Game in Python for LightIT
A game written in Python according to the second test task for courses in Python
## TASK
***
> It is necessary to develop a simulation of the game in the form of a console application. The participants are Computer and Player. The sequence of moves is determined randomly. Each of the players should have the same amount of health (for example 100) and the choice (also randomly) of the following of the steps:  
> 1. should cause moderate damage and has a small range (e.g. 18-25)  
> 2. must have a wide range of damage (e.g. 10-35)  
> 3. should heal in a small range (in the same as in paragraph 1)  
>  
> After each action, a message should be printed that reports what happened and how much health the Player and Computer have. When the computer's health reaches, for example, 35%, increase its chance of cure.  
The game ends if one of the participants has reached 0 health.
